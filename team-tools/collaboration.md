A key component of a successful hackathon is being able to efficiently 
collaborate with other members of your team. There are many different 
free tools that can help you with this. Some collaboration tools that 
might support your project include but are not limited to:

## Code Collaboration Tools
- [GitHub][github-home]
- [BitBucket][bitbucket]

## Project Management Tools
- [GitHub Projects][gh-projects]
- [Trello][trello]

## Documentation Collaboration Tools
- [Google Drive][gdrive]

# GitHub

For many developers, Git is an invaluable tool of any software
development stack. A version control system is a great way
to keep your projects backed up, centralized, tracked, and
accessible to be worked on with others.

GitHub is a website that builds on the functionality of Git,
it hosts your projects in a single place and adds some useful
project tracking features that can be accessed in its easy-to-use
website. You can [make an account here][github-join] and
[sign up for the student discounts here.][gh-student-pack]

Git is (normally) just a console application, but many IDEs
have built in support for git version control tracking.
  - [Git for Visual Studio][git-for-vs]
  - [Git integration in Jetbrains IDEs][git-intellij]

In addition, if you are new to git or unfamiliar with the command
line, [the GitHub Desktop GUI client is great for beginners.][github-desktop]

## Guides For Getting Started

You'll first want to install git. [Refer to the official documentation for instructions on how to install git on Windows, Linux or mac.][installing-git]

There are many guides out there for getting started with git, that explain it
more effectively and in depth than we can here. Here are links to some of
those guides.

### Powerpoint Slides from the ACM GitHub Open Source Workshop

_Very special thanks to [Craig Nishina @cnishina][cnishina] and [Evan Harris @WhiteBoardDev][whiteboarddev] for providing and presenting these slides._

These slides were provided from the ACM GitHub Open Source workshop, which
explain most of the important concepts of Git, from getting started with
working locally, to pushing to a public repo and setting up Continuous Integration.

[Day 1 Slides][day-1]. These slides cover the basics, including "What is Git?",
getting started with commits, branching, and merging.

[Day 2 Slides][day-2]. These slides cover the basics of GitHub, Markdown,
forking, pull requests, and issues.

[Day 3 Slides][day-3]. These slides cover the basics of continuous integration,
documentation, and contributing to StackOverflow.

### Other Guides

[GitHub Guides][gh-guides] _GitHub provides many guides for using
git, making use of their desktop client and website._

[Git Getting Started][git-getting-started] _The official getting
started guide provided by git. These all assume that you are using
the command line, so may be advanced for beginners._

## Issue Tracking with GitHub

Using issues on GitHub allows you to track work on things like new features, 
bugs, tasks, etc. on your repository. You can attach labels to issues to help 
you sort and organize your issues. You also can assign members of your team to 
work on a issue.

GitHub provides multiple guides for using issues:
- [About issues][gh-aboutissues]
- [Creating an issue][gh-createissue] 
- [Assigning issues and pull requests to other GitHub users][gh-assignissue] 
- [Applying labels to issues and pull requests][gh-issuelabel]

## GitHub Projects

To assist with tracking progress on projects across a single or multiple 
repositories, GitHub offers a feature called project boards. These project 
boards allow you to organize the various tasks for your repository. A common 
layout that is used is a three column layout where you have a column for tasks 
to do, a column for tasks that are in-progress, and a column for tasks that have 
been completed. These columns are populated by card that you make that contain 
information about the task that needs to be done. This can be as simple as a text 
note or can even be a issue or pull request from your repository. Using issues or 
pull requests as cards also allows for automation of the project board, allowing the 
cards to automatically move between columns. 

GitHub provides multiple guides for working with project boards:
- [Managing project boards][gh-managepb] 
- [Creating a project board][gh-createpb] 
- [Adding notes to a project board][gh-pbnotes]
- [Adding issues and pull requests to a project board][gh-pbaddlinked]
