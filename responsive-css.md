# Styling your website to be responsive

## Mobile-First Design

## Viewport

The viewport is the part of the webpage that's currently visible to the user. Viewports vary between different devices,
as the screen size between devices also varies. For example, the viewport of a desktop monitor will be significantly larger than the viewport of
a mobile device.

The viewport can be controlled by setting a `<meta>` tag in each web page you'd like to make responsive. The following is an example of how to use this tag:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

`width=device-width` sets the width of the viewport to match the width of the device. This is useful for devices (such as mobile devices) that have less width compared to the height of the device.

`initial-scale` sets the zoom factor of the viewport to the value of the scale provided. We set this to `1.0` to set it as the default zoom for the viewport when the webpage is first loaded.
