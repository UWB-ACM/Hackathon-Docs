Now that you have a webpage and are ready to deploy it, you need to 
set up a domain name for your website. This wiki will walk you through 
that process.

## Step 1: Obtain a Domain Name

It is recommended to get a domain name off of [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com), 
but you can purchase a domain name from other providers (including 
[GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) and [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/domains)).

To get your domain name:
- Create an account with the provider of your choosing.
- Pick a name that sounds good to you. NameCheap has convenient search 
  functionality to help you find the perfect domain name for your 
  project.
- **For NameCheap:** select [WhoIsGuard](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/278/37/what-is-whoisguard) 
as an option when you are going through checkout, if it is available 
for your domain's TLD. WhoIsGuard is a free service that NameCheap 
provides that protects your personal information 
when other people run `whois` on your domain name.
- Purchase the domain name.

And you're done!

_Note: avoid purchasing extra paid services (like NameCheap's PremiumDNS 
service); these add-on purchases are not necessary with adequate site 
configuration and a little know-how._

## Step 2: Forward the Domain Name to a DNS Provider

If you are using Digital Ocean to host your site (as recommended in 
the [hackathon docs](Server-Creation)), you can set up domain name 
system (DNS) forwarding to Digital Ocean directly. The required steps 
are described in detail [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars).

Here's a quick run-down of the steps involved:
- Log into your domain purchasing site (in this example, we'll use 
  NameCheap).
- Go to the management page for the domain you bought. In NameCheap, 
  this will be under [Dashboard](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/dashboard).
- Under the domain you bought, click "Manage".
- Under the "Nameservers" section, select "Custom DNS" in the dropdown, 
  and add the server URLs for Digital Ocean. They are 
  `ns[1-3].digitalocean.com`. The end result should look like this:
  ![Namecheap Dns](/uploads/namecheap_dns.png "Namecheap Dns").
- Click the green check mark to save the DNS settings for the domain.

After saving, you will see a confirmation alert, and the alert will 
tell you the DNS server update may take up to 48 hours to take effect. 
Don't panic; normally DNS changes propogate in 30-45 minutes.

If you choose to use another provider, you may have to forward the 
domain to a third-party DNS provider; we recommend using 
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) or 
[Hurricaine Electric](https://dns.he.net/) because these services 
are free, secure, easy to use, reliable, and informative.

_Optional but recommended:_ While you're in the management page 
for the domain, scroll to the bottom of the page to the section 
labeled "Other Domain Settings". Where it says "Parking Page", 
click the button labeled "Turn Off" to turn off the parking page.

_Note: a NameCheap "Parking Page" is a default page that gets 
displayed when users try to navigate to your site before the site 
has been set up._

## Step 3: Point the DNS Nameserver Records to Your Server

This steps allows the DNS nameserver to redirect traffic to the 
machine(s) you specify, so that web traffic will have content served 
from the machine containing your webpage files.

To set up basic IPv4 name records on your droplet, follow these steps:
- Log into your Digital Ocean dashboard.
- Go to the Networking Management page in Digital Ocean 
  [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/domains?fleetUuid=null&i=a309dd).
  It can also be accessed by going to Create -> Domains/DNS from the 
  toolbar at the top of the page.
- Enter your new domain in the text box on the Networking page, and 
  click "Add Domain". An example is provided below.
  ![Add New Domain](/uploads/add_new_domain.png "Add New Domain").
- On the next page, create a new record. The record creation tells 
  Digital Ocean's nameservers to route traffic for the domain to an 
  IP or server of your choice; in this example, traffic for 
  [phry.me](http://phry.me) and [lol.phry.me](http://lol.phry.me) 
  will be directed to the droplet created earlier.
  ![Records Examples](/uploads/records_examples.png "Records Examples").
- This step is complete, and traffic will now be redirected to your 
  droplet!

Detailed information about the various types of name records to 
create in Digital Ocean's dashboard are available 
[here](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/).

_If you are not using Digital Ocean to serve your content, you can 
create additional DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc) in the dashboard 
of your DNS provider. It is recommended to use Hurricaine Electric; 
check out their DNS configuration docs [here](https://dns.he.net/docs.html)._
