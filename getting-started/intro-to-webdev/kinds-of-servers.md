## An Overview of Different Hosting Options

Web hosting can be separated into several different categories of provided options.

## Shared Web Hosting

Shared web hosting is when your server is shared with tens to hundreds of other websites.
These websites share the hosts system resources. Typically this service is not flexible, and
you are provided limited access to the system. Shared hosting is usually offered by resellers.

## Reseller Web Hosting

A prebuilt option that allows clients to offer the same services to other clients. Resellers
can vary in size. They can offer a myriad of services, and will typically charge slightly more
for their own technical support. Resellers are companies like Hostgator, A2 Hosting, GoDaddy,
Inmotion hosting, SiteGround, etc.

## Virtual Dedicated Servers (VPS)

Also referred to as a Virtual Private Server, this service uses special software to divide server
resources into different virtual machines. With a VPS you will have root access to your machine
and can modify your VM image, install new software, update existing software, etc.

## Dedicated Hosting

With dedicated hosting you get a web server and full control over it. This includes full root access
and no restrictions in regards to software. However you do not own the server, you are merely renting
it. You are still liable for damages, and for security and maintenance.

## Managed Hosting

You are not given full control of the server. You are allowed to manage data via File Transfer Protocol
`FTP` only, you are not given root access.

## Colocation Web Hosting

Similar to dedicated hosting, but the user fully owns the server. The hosting company provides the
space and maintains it. This is typically for large clients, which may have a dedicated tech maintain
the server in a datacenter.

## Cloud Hosting

Offers dynamic pricing, scalability, reliablility, and load balanced services. Highly reliable as
VMs aren't dependent on specific hardware. We recommend cloud hosting for most web hosting tasks.

## Clustered Hosting

Multiple servers host the same content for better resource utilization. Great for high-availability dedicated
hosting, and scalable web hosting.

## Grid Hosting

A form of distributed hosting when a server cluster acts like a grid and is composed of multiple `nodes`.

## Home Server

A single personal computer at a private residence used for hosting one or more websites on a consumer-grade
broadband connection. ISPs sometimes block this ability by disallowing incoming requests to TCP port 80, or
by refusing to provide `static IP addresses`.
